So here it is. Again, I did it my way, which is, most likely, not the best one. Easy to use:

Get the jar-File and type the following in the command prompt:

java -jar CreateJson.jar input.txt output.txt

you can name those two files either way you want. The outputfile will be generated if it doesn't already exists.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
